1. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
$ git init

2. Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
$ git add .
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.

3. Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
$ git commit -m "First commit"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.

4. In Terminal, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
$ git remote add origin "remote repository URL"
# Sets the new remote
$ git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL

5. Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
$ git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
